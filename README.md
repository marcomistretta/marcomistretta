# 👋 Hi, I’m Marco Mistretta!

I'm an **AI enthusiast** with a solid background in **Computer Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I'm currently pursuing a **PhD at MICC** (Media Integration and Communication Center) in Florence, Italy. My research journey is centered around exploring the fascinating world of **multimodal Vision-Language Models** and their diverse applications in real-world scenarios.

## 🌟 What I’m Passionate About:

I'm deeply invested in:
- 🧠 **Multimodal Learning**: Bridging the gap between vision and language for a unified understanding of data.
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Making machines understand and generate human language.
- 🖼️ **Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning**: Unlocking patterns in data without the need for labels.
- ♻️ **Incremental Learning**: Continuously learning from new data while retaining previous knowledge.
- 🎯 **Few-Shot Adaptation**: Achieving fast adaptation to a diverse data distribution with minimal examples.
- 📝 **Prompt Learning**: Tuning only a few learnable parameters, so-called "prompts", to maximize VLMs performance.
- 🚀 **Test-Time Adaptation**: Optimizing models during inference to adapt to unseen data and domains.

## 📝 Recent Publications:
- [**Improving Zero-shot Generalization of Learned Prompts via Unsupervised Knowledge Distillation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03056) – Published at **ECCV 2024**, co-authored with some brilliant minds: **Alberto Baldrati, Marco Bertini, and Andrew D. Bagdanov**.

## 🚀 Skills & Technologies:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, MATLAB, R
- **Frameworks & Tools**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, OpenCV
- **Research Areas**: Vision-Language Models, Self-Supervised Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Prompt Learning, Incremental Learning
