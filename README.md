<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Marco Mistretta!</h1>

I’m a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at [MICC](https://www.micc.unifi.it/), University of Florence, working under the guidance of [Prof. Andrew D. Bagdanov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_Fk4YUcAAAAJ) and [Prof. Marco Bertini](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=SBm9ZpYAAAAJ&hl=en).
With a background in Computer Engineering and AI, my research focuses on pushing the boundaries of **Multimodal Vision-Language Models** (like CLIP) and their real-world applications.

This expertise is demonstrated through **my first-author publications** in top-tier venues, including [ECCV (main conference)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03056), [NeurIPS (workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17827), [ICLR (main conference)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VVVfuIcmKR).
These works reflect my dedication to solving challenging problems and advancing the field of AI.

Currently **seeking a 2025 internship** to contribute to innovative teams and apply my expertise to real-world challenges!

## 🌟 What Drives Me:
I'm really into:
- 🧠 **Multimodal Learning**: Combining visual and language data to get a richer understanding of the world.
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Teaching machines to understand and communicate in human language.
- 🖼️ **Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without the need for human labels.
- ♻️ **Incremental Learning**: Allowing AI models to keep learning from new information without forgetting the old ones.
- 🎯 **Few-Shot Adaptation**: Quickly adapting AI to a diverse data distribution with minimal examples.
- 📝 **Prompt Learning**: Tuning only a few learnable parameters, so-called "prompts", to maximize VLMs performance.
- 🚀 **Test-Time Adaptation**: Letting models adjust during inference to handle unseen data on the fly.

## 🚀 Skills & Technologies:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, MATLAB, R
- **Frameworks & Tools**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, OpenCV
- **Research Areas**: Vision-Language Models, Self-Supervised Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Prompt Learning, Incremental Learning
